Introduction
------------
This is smart social media querrying system to find targeted audience for campaigns, colaborations, advertisements, or similar events. 

The user can start using the application by just entering a querry eg. "Find me the list of musicians I can collaborate with" then enter some search keywords like "musician, dj, artist", constraints like "in Germany, followers > 100" and thats it! We give you the list of optimal collaborators. 

This is not limited to individual users, companies can join our subscription model to have multiple campaigns.
