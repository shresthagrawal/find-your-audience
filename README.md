Introduction
------------
This is a smart social media querying system to find targeted audience for campaigns, collaborations, advertisements, or similar events. 

The user can start using the web application by just entering a query about a category eg. "Find me the list of musicians I can collaborate with", then entering some search keywords like "musician, dj, artist", constraints like "in Germany, followers > 100" and thats it! We give you the list of optimal collaborators. 

This is not limited to individual users. Companies can also join our subscription model to have multiple campaigns.
